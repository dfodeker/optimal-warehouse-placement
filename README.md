### Coding Exercise: Optimal Warehouse Item Placement

**Background:** You are tasked with developing a software module that helps a warehouse optimize the placement of items to achieve quicker inventory checks, faster shipping times, and reduced physical workload for staff. The warehouse stores `N` different types of items. Each item type has a specific frequency of access (how often it's retrieved for shipping) and a weight.

**Objective:** Your software module should determine the optimal placement of these item types within the warehouse to minimize the total retrieval time and physical strain on the warehouse staff. Assume the warehouse layout is a grid, with each cell representing a storage slot that can hold one type of item. The entrance (and shipping area) is located at the bottom-left corner of the grid.

**Constraints:**

*   Each item type's frequency of access and weight are provided as inputs.
*   The distance to retrieve an item is measured in "steps" from the entrance/shipping area.
*   Heavier items should be placed closer to the entrance to reduce physical strain, but high-frequency items should also be easily accessible.

**Inputs:**

1.  A list of item types, each with a frequency of access score and a weight.
2.  Dimensions of the warehouse grid (width x height).

**Outputs:**

1.  A suggested layout of item types within the grid, optimizing for the constraints mentioned.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm should minimize the total number of steps required to retrieve items based on their frequency of access.
*   **Ergonomics:** The placement should consider the weight of items, placing heavier items closer to the entrance when possible.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be efficient and scalable for different warehouse sizes and a large number of item types.

### Desired Solution

A desired solution would entail:

1.  **Algorithm Design:** A clear and efficient algorithm that calculates the optimal item placement based on the given inputs. This might involve sorting items by their frequency and weight, then strategically placing them to balance the need for accessibility with the goal of minimizing strain.
2.  **Data Structures:** Use of appropriate data structures to manage the warehouse grid and the properties of item types (e.g., trees, graphs, arrays).
3.  **Optimization Techniques:** Application of optimization techniques or heuristics that can effectively handle the trade-offs between item accessibility and physical strain.
4.  **Code Quality:** Clean, readable code with comments explaining the logic behind key decisions.
5.  **Test Cases:** A set of test cases that demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across different scenarios, including edge cases.

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implementing features that simulate real-world constraints, such as varying aisle widths or obstacles in the warehouse.
*   Providing a visualization of the warehouse layout before and after optimization.

This exercise tests candidates on multiple levels, including algorithm design, understanding of optimization problems, and practical application of data structures.
